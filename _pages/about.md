I'm Chris @REal0day Magistrado. I've spent over 10 years working on cybersecurity, especially finding and fixing vulnerabilities in software. I also help companies hire top cybersecurity talent. I also started a podcast called [Hackers to Founders](https://HackersToFounders.com/), where I talk with people who went from cybersecurity experts to business owners. Recently, I’m getting into mobile security research, government projects, bringing security talent to the places that need it most. 

Let’s connect to talk about the future of tech and cybersecurity.
