I'm Chris @REal0day Magistrado. I've spent over 10 years working on cybersecurity, especially finding and fixing vulnerabilities in software. Now, I run [TopCleared Recruiting](https://TopClearedRecruiting.com/), where I help companies hire top cybersecurity talent. I also started a podcast called [Hackers to Founders](https://HackersToFounders.com/), where I talk with people who went from cybersecurity experts to business owners. Recently, I’m getting into government projects, bringing security talent to the places that need it most. 

Let’s connect to talk about the future of tech and cybersecurity.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
